A robust **Water-Level Monitoring and Alert System** leveraging an **ESP8266** module and **Ubidots IoT platform** for real-time monitoring and alerting. This project efficiently tracks water levels and sends alerts to ensure timely actions.

## üìã Features

- **Real-Time Water Level Monitoring**: Continuously tracks the water level using sensors.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Automatically sends alerts via Ubidots when the water level is low.
- **Wi-Fi Integration**: Uses ESP8266 to connect to your Wi-Fi network for seamless communication.
- **LED Indication**: Indicates critical water level conditions using an LED.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjustable for various use cases and thresholds.
